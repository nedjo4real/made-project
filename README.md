## Introduction
The goal of this project is to determine whether higher academic qualifications correlate with higher income. By analyzing open datasets, the project seeks to provide evidence-based insights into the financial benefits of advanced degrees.

---

## Data Sources
The data used in this project comes from publicly available open datasets. These datasets were cleaned, transformed, and analyzed as part of the project workflow. Specific details about the datasets are provided in the `project/data` directory.

---

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were utilized:
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - NumPy: Numerical computations
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
- **Other Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive code and visualization
  - GitHub: Version control
  - GitHub Actions: Continuous integration for automation

---

## Methodology
The project followed these steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Open datasets were sourced and downloaded.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Inconsistent and missing values were handled to ensure data quality.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Key insights were drawn using visualizations and descriptive statistics.
4. **Statistical Analysis**: Regression and other methods were applied to evaluate correlations.
5. **Results Interpretation**: Findings were summarized in the context of academic qualifications and income.

## Results
Key findings of the analysis are summarized below:
- Higher degrees generally correlate with increased income.
- Exceptions exist in specific fields where experience outweighs academic qualifications.
- Detailed insights are available in the `project/` directory.
